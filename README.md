# treact-challenge

Treact Duplicate Challenge is a simple landing page meant to demonstrate layout and design skills using vanilla HTML and CSS. Minimal JavaScript was used for mobile menu interactivity. This is a recreation of https://treact.owaiskhan.me/components/landingPages/SaaSProductLandingPage simply by looking at the website and using HTML and CSS.
